Bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight loss than non-surgical options.

After surgery statistically fewer people had metabolic syndrome and there was higher remission of Type 2 diabetes than in non-surgical groups.},

Their study did notfurther comment on this mismatch.

How-ever, gender was a factor for patient selection in those with abody mass index ofp35 kg/m2without comorbidities, withmen having 67% decreased odds of selection.[21]

Furthermore, female patients who underwent bariatric surgery are generally in better health than males as measured by the Charlson ComorbidityIndex.},
